# social-network-api

## Description
This project is designed to be utilized as a back-end for a social media platform, allowing users to post thoughts, add friends, and react to other users posts.

## Installation
RequiresMongoDB, express, and mongoose. Run 'npm i' to install dependencies, and 'npm start' to initiate the server.

## Usage
This back-end logic can be utilized by linking one user to another as a 'friend,' linking thoughts to the user that posted it, reactions linked to the user that posted the reaction as well as the thought being reacted to. Given that this is only the back-end of the program, functionality will need an api route testing program.

## Testing
API routes were tested for functionality in Insomnia.
